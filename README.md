# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Omer Saleh**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Leaflet.js** in order to help me make a **geography game**. This game helps users practice their geography skills by tasking them to type as many countries as they can recall from their memory. I utilized leaflet.js in order to effectively employ an interactive map for the user to play with. I have implemented a score holder so that the user knows how many of the existing 197 countries they have gotten.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Allows you to enter country despite any spaces or capitilization
* Marks the country as soon as you enter it correctly
* Prevents you from retyping the same country multiple times
* Very fun to keep practicing and notice improvements in practices
* Visually pleasing and is very practical in utilization
##### CONS
* Marker is visibly too large and sometimes covers small countries
* Some countries are not geographically accurate like Montenegro
* No auto-correcter which prevents users from really testing their knowledge
* Need to type out the entire names of the country; no acronyms
* Could've given more general hints instead of straight up giving country name
