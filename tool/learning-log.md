# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Kaboom & Leaflet & D3**

Project: **Geography Game**

---

10/29/23:
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)
    * Followed tutorial and created an interactive map in JsBin
        * [JsBin Example](https://jsbin.com/kicetoniwe/1/edit?html,css,js,output)
        * Leaflet code is available (copy & paste)
    * Watched [Leaflet Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QFkgOeQc0c&list=PLDmvslp_VR0xjh7wGMNd_1kk0zUox6Sue)
    * bindPopup --> creates a pop up
        * A lot of new terms need to be learned such as polygon, L.map, etc
* How do I alter the map with inputs? Ie; when I let the user insert a country name, how can it be marked/ changed?
    * Conditionals??
* How can I combine both Kaboom and Leaflet?
* Next Steps:
    * Tinker/ Play around with Kaboom


11/5/23
* [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add)
    * Created a kaboom background and changed the sprites into a different one
        * Done in IDE @ kaboomTinkering.html
        * Lots of examples online to be inspired from
    * Watched 10 minutes of [Kaboom Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU)
    * rotate() component gives sprite rotation
        * tutorials usually define the code in the comments
* Do I need a sprite for my geography game? Should I add one?
    * Use sprite and allow it to speak if country guessed is right or wrong
* What purpose does the sprite have in my future game?
* Next Steps Tomorrow:
    * Tinker with D3 JS
    * Confirm Tools


11/13/23
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)
    * Watched 10 minutes of this youtube video called [Introduction To Leaflet JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOg5GDy2Ih4&list=PLDmvslp_VR0xjh7wGMNd_1kk0zUox6Sue&index=2)
        * Created a map with a pop-up in IDE @ leaf1.js
* If you want to use a pop-up, bind it to whatever shape desire to associate with w/ info
* Can we change the shape of the pop up?
* How can I combine both Kaboom and Leaflet?
    * Still not sure --> more research needed
* Make sure to finish all the videos in the youtube series --> very helpful
    * Follow through as well just like today
* Next Steps:
    * Finish watching the YouTube video
    * Try to create a mini-game with Leaflet & Kaboom


11/19/23
* [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add)
    * Watched the remaining of this [Kaboom Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU)
        * Could utilize a key in doing an action using `keyPress()`
        * Include `.jump` next a sprite variable number to make it jump
    * Created a flappy game using Kaboom that includes a sprite that jumps in IDE @ kab2.js
        * Code is correct but is not showing as preview
        * Learned that `scale` makes the screen bigger or smaller depending on the value
    * Why is the code just showing when I use `http-server`?
    * Does Kaboom have to be downloaded to be used?
    * Next Steps:
        * Try to create flappy but @ Repl.it --> that's where the video was doing it
        * Go through this [Kaboom document](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/kaboom/kaboom-editor) & follow it in IDE
