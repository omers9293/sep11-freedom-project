#### Content + MVP FINISHED!

Since the last blog entry, I have worked hard and was able to finish my MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and now have a finished project of what I was planning to do all along. However, I made the very important decision to not use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) and to only solely use the tool that I was most comfortable with which was [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/). I decided to do this since there wasn't any practical way to combine both Leaflet.js and Kaboom and the online resources for me to learn it were very scarce. Nevertheless, I was able to create the geography game that I planned for using the concepts that we learned in class including conditionals, loops, arrays, functions, and the tool I learned on my own, leaflet.js. I will explain some of obstacles that I encountered throughout the process of creating the working code for my freedom project.
