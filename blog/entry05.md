#### Content + MVP FINISHED!

Since the last blog entry, I have worked and was able to finish my MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and now have a finish project of what I was planning to do all along. However, I made the very important decision to not use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) and to only solely use the tool that I was most comfortable with which was [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/). I decided to do this since there wasn't any practical way to combine both Leaflet.js and Kaboom and the online resouces for me to learn it was very scarce.
