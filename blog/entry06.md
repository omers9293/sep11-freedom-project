#### Content
I have officially finished my 11th-grade freedom project, including both the presentation and the expo's elevator pitch. I feel very much relieved that I was able to stay productive throughout this year so I wasn't burnt out in the end. I had a lot of fun creating this project throughout the year and I'm glad I picked this topic because it is something I'm genuinely passionate about. I used to suck at geography and wouldn't be able to name out 10 countries and now I can name over 100 in less than 5 minutes. I hope that this project can help at least one other person with their geography skills because being aware of where countries are located is very important in the geopolitical world and understanding why some countries are not very friendly with others.

##### Expo elevator pitch Takeaways

##### In-class presentation Takeaways
I feel like I have grown so much better at presenting in front of a large audience because I didn't feel as nervous this time as I did last year. Part of that was because I listened to Mr Mueller's advice about how "if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail" and so I was very much prepared on what I was going to say. I don't think I stuttered that much because I took quick pauses which enabled me not to use any filler words.
